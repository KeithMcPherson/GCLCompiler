This is how to use autoruntests.sh (or .bat) to run all of your tests at once. 

The autoruntests.sh file assumes a certain setup. If your setup is not the same you may be able to 
edit the file to make it work, or you can alter the setup. 

It is written for unix (including macosx) If you use autoruntests.bat instead. The file is run from 
the command line (a shell in unix and a command window in windows.)

The setup has this folder hierarchy
ProJect Folder
	bin 
	src
	tests

Both the bin folder and the src folder have a package (gcl) folder. Note that I put all tests into a folder. 

 Also (important), The sam3 and macc3 tools are in the project folder (but not a subfolder)

On Windows use autoruntests.bat. 

Next, install the batch file as an external tool under Eclipse so that you don't need the shell/command window:

Select Run/External Tools/External Tools Configurations...
In the dialog give it a name (runAll). Fill in the Location by Browse Workspace to 
${workspace_loc:/GCLSkeletons/tests/autoruntests.sh}
Fill in Working Directory by Browse Workspace to:
${workspace_loc:/GCLSkeletons/bin}
Now Apply and either close or run. 

Note that everything in this file except for the tests that the skeleton's can handle (test0).

NOTE: You can also use this as you go, before you finish the compiler to make sure that you haven't 
broken old code when you write new code. Just uncomment the sections that you are working with. 
If you leave the old ones uncommented, then you will know if you break something you did earlier. 

On unix if you want to run this from a shell you must first make it executable with chmod, of course.
